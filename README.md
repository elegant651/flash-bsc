# Flash BSC

The user acquires an NFT coupon with a unique ticket number by purchasing ticket. A random ticket is drawn at a fixed time interval and eliminates the number from the pool. If the ticket number is the same as the lottery number, the user can get the coupon. Users can swap coupon to dai with Aave Flash loan easily. 

Smart contract: We use Kovan testnet to deploy smart contracts. \
- Coupon.sol : ERC-721 based NFT contract. it includes buyTicket, distribution, claimPrize, claimReturn.
- Faucet.sol : ERC-20 based Faucet contract
- RandomNumberConsumer.sol : Use chainlink VRF for generate random number
- AVGFlashLoan.sol : Aave flash loan, which includes flashloan =>swap=>deposit=>borrow=>payback flashloan process. At first, loans as many dai as the value of the coupon. then swap another coupon (less current value) with that dai (dex - uniswap or 1inch). After sell to existing coupon then repay the amount of dai to aave. (...ing)
Frontend: React, web3 library, IPFS, bootstrap\



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
